# Views
Views are the code that get run when a URL is accessed.
They are the logic behind each of the Services.

Each view file represents a Service, and they usually have two classes contained within; `Collection` and `Resource`.
`Collection` contains methods that are run without passing an object id, `Resource` methods require an id.
The following is a map of Service Methods to REST methods;

- `Collection.get`: `list`
- `Collection.post`: `create`
- `Resource.get`: `read`
- `Resource.put`: `update`
- `Resource.patch`: `partial_update`
- `Resource.delete`: `delete`

When writing view files, the methods should be in this order.
The same is true for [Controllers](/layout/controllers) and [Permissions](/layout/permissions), and anywhere else that uses these names.

The views will use controllers to validate user data, check permissions, use models to interact with the database and user serializers to turn objects into dictionaries.
We also use tracing, and views should make spans for each logical block to track time taken for each part of the view.
See [Spans](/style/spans) for more details.
